# WARNING

The version of this project recorded in the package.json has returned to 0.1.0.

The reason for this is that the project has split in to two separate entities, both of which are new projects.

These projects have been setup in preparation for use in a monorepo. If this fails then it is likely that we will want to return this project to it's `harpnative` title and continue as though the split had not occurred. Therefore these new packages have been built and tagged on feature branches. Since both of the project tags will exist on the same repo, it has been necessary to prefix them with the project name. In this case harpguru-expo-boilerplate.v0.x.x.

# HarpGuruExpoBoilerplate

This project is simply some expo boilerplate set up to run the HarpGuru application.
